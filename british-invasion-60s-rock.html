      <h1>British Invasion of '60s Rock</h1>
      <p>
        In the mid-1960s, rock bands from the United Kingdom started gaining
        traction with their takes on rock n' roll. The sound was heavier and
        more raw than the rock n' roll music in America. Much of this music was
        considered "hard rock" or just simply "rock". This music perpetuated the
        rebellious nature of early rock n' roll and its popularity with
        teenagers at the time. With this music gaining popularity with American
        audiences, America began its own scene of harder music as well.
        Eventually, this inspired the psycheleia subculture, or "hippie"
        subculture known for its use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and
        cannabis.

        The subject matter of music in this era tended to vary due to some of
        the events happening at the time. Due to the psychedelic subculture,
        bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones wrote music about this
        culture and the drugs involved in the subculture. This subject matter
        carried over into the '70s with bands like Pink Floyd and eventually
        inspired stoner rock and stoner metal.

        One sub-genre at the time that was important in the Civil Rights
        movement was motown. Motown was a fusion of R&B and 60s rock popular
        among African-American musicians like the Jackson 5, Aretha Franklin,
        Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Stevie Wonder.

        The '60s also saw protest music that was written in response to news
        events at the time. Civil rights was a subject that brought forward
        protest music, but it became increasingly popular during the time of the
        Vietnam War and its accompanying draft. This subject matter was
        widespread across many bands at the time, though there weren't many
        bands who were specifically "protest bands". It was mostly an issue many
        bands talked about without focusing all of their music on it.

        Other notable musicians at this time were The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Bob
        Dylan, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and Led Zeppelin.
