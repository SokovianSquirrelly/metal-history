      <h1>Early Rock n' Roll</h1>
      <p>
        Our journey starts in the late '40s throughout the '50s with rock n'
        roll. Much of early rock n' roll was inspired by African American music
        such as jazz, blues, and gospel. Typically, rock n' roll music had a
        dance-like rhythm with a strong backbeat. Some people say that rock n'
        roll was especially important in the civil rights movement because it
        was a favorite among both black and white teenagers in America. Notable
        rock n' roll musicians from this era included Chuck Berry, Fats Domino,
        and of course, the legendary Elvis Presley.

        Early on, rock n' roll was performed using a piano or saxiphone as a
        lead instrument. Rock n' roll bands also had an upright bass and some
        simple percussion (like a snare drum) that drove the accentuated
        backbeat. By the mid-50s, these instruments had been largely replaced or
        supplimented by one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm), an
        electric bass, and a drum set. Rock n' roll became the genre of choice
        when it came to dance music, which then inspired other music genres for
        dancing such as hip hop, funk, disco, and techno.
