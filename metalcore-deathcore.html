      <h1>Metalcore & Deathcore</h1>
      <p>
        Metalcore is defined as a fusion genre between extreme metal and
        hardcore punk. It is noted for passages in music in which there are
        slow, heavy, intense passages of instrumentals conductive for moshing.
        These passages were often referred to as breakdowns. While other
        subgenres that combine metal and punk also have this element, metalcore
        is by far the most popular. Guitars would often have heavy riffs and
        sometimes stop-start rhythms, drummers would sometimes use blast beats,
        and vocalists would typically use thrash or screaming vocals.
      </p>

        When metalcore first started in America in the mid-90s, bands used more
        elements of hardcore punk than with heavy metal, especially in vocals.
        This music was rarely, if ever, melodic. This early version of metalcore
        was often known as "metallic hardcore", since it was essentially
        hardcore punk with metal guitar riffs. Notable bands from this era
        include Hatebreed, Poison the Well, Eighteen Visions, and Integrity.

        Starting in the early-2000s, metalcore started to shift in its style and
        influence, and also became more popular and approachable. Many bands of
        this era started to use more melodic vocals and instrumentation and
        their influence came from melodic death metal. This became known as
        "melodic metalcore", though later was mostly just known simply as
        "metalcore" since many bands stuck to the more melodic style of the
        2000s. Notable bands from this era include Killswitch Engage, As I Lay
        Dying, Trivium, Bullet for My Valentine, and All That Remains. This also
        became a popular genre for "scene" bands such as Bring Me the Horizon,
        Asking Alexandria, and A Day to Remember.

        As the 2000s moved on, other subgenres of metalcore emerged, such as
        electronicore and mathcore, but the one with the biggest impact was
        deathcore. Deathcore is a fusion between metalcore and death metal,
        employing many of the same elements as metalcore though with more death
        growls and brutal instrumentation. Notable bands include Whitechapel,
        Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Job For a Cowboy, and Carnifex. Deathcore
        was also popular for people who identified as "scene", especially with
        bands like Suicide Silence.

        Unfortunately, this original scene of deathcore was pretty short-lived
        due to the untimely death of Suicide Silence vocalist, Mitch Lucker.
        Just like how Kurt Cobain was the icon of the grunge scene, Lucker was
        the icon of the deathcore scene in the early 2010s, so the death of an
        icon like Lucker was a hit to the scene. While Suicide Silence, along
        with many other deathcore bands at the time, did continue touring and
        writing music, they were unfortunately no longer at their peak.

        However, in 2020 and 2021, deathcore started a revival due to two bands:
        Lorna Shore and Slaughter to Prevail. Both bands had been active for a
        number of years at this point, but they were nowhere near mainstream
        until the 2020s. For Lorna Shore, they released their song "To the
        Hellfire", which was the first song released with their new vocalist,
        Will Ramos. This song incorporated elements of black metal and symphonic
        metal into deathcore, and with the addition of Ramos's over-the-top
        vocals, it quickly grabbed the attention of the internet on platforms
        like TikTok and YouTube. Around the same time, Slaughter to Prevail saw
        similar success with their songs "Demolisher" and "Baba Yaga". Both
        songs also gained a lot of attention on YouTube and TikTok, which helped
        kickstart many other deathcore bands and their careers. Some of these
        other bands include Brand of Sacrifice, Ov Sulfur, Infant Annihilator,
        and Shadow of Intent.
