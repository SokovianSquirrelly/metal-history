      <h1>Metalcore & Deathcore</h1>
      <p>
        Metalcore is defined as a fusion genre between extreme metal and
        hardcore punk. It is noted for passages in music in which there are
        slow, heavy, intense passages of instrumentals conductive for moshing.
        While other subgenres that combine metal and punk also have this
        element, metalcore is by far the most popular. Guitars would often have
        heavy riffs and sometimes stop-start rhythms, drummers would sometimes
        use blast beats, and vocalists would typically use thrash or screaming
        vocals.

        When metalcore first started in America in the mid-90s, bands used more
        elements of hardcore punk than with heavy metal, especially in vocals.
        This music was rarely, if ever, melodic. Notable bands from this era
        include Hatebreed, Poison the Well, Eighteen Visions, and Integrity.

        Starting in the early-2000s, metalcore started to shift in its style and
        influence, and also became more popular and approachable. Many bands of
        this era started to use more melodic vocals and instrumentation and
        their influence came from melodic death metal. This became known as
        "melodic metalcore", though later was mostly just known simply as
        "metalcore" since many bands stuck to the more melodic style of the
        2000s. Notable bands from this era include Killswitch Engage, As I Lay
        Dying, Trivium, Bullet for My Valentine, and All That Remains. This also
        became a popular genre for "scene" bands such as Bring Me the Horizon,
        Asking Alexandria, and A Day to Remember.

        Metalcore also spawned sub-subgenres like deathcore, electronicore,
        easycore, and mathcore. Of these, deathcore is arguably the most
        popular. Deathcore is a fusion between metalcore and death metal,
        employing many of the same elements as metalcore though with more death
        growls and brutal instrumentation. Notable bands include Whitechapel,
        Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Carnifex, Slaughter to Prevail, and later
        on, Lorna Shore. Deathcore was also popular for people who identified as
        "scene", especially with bands like Suicide Silence.
