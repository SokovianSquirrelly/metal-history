      <h1>The Birth of Heavy Metal</h1>
      <p>
        In 1970, a band from Birmingham, England called Black Sabbath released
        their debut album. Their music was darker and heavier than the raw sound
        of the '60s hard rock bands and it started a new genre that we know
        today as heavy metal. Upon this album being released, Deep Purple and
        Led Zeppelin also helped to pioneer the genre. They also made music that
        carried the heavier and thicker sound that started with Black Sabbath.
        This new musical phenomenon attracted audiences quickly despite critics
        deriding the new heavier music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heavy metal evolved quickly. Styles and theatrics like the shock rock of
        Alice Cooper and Kiss, the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith, and the
        flashy guitar work of Van Halen were added to the genre, continuing to
        mold it into the genre it was to become. The mid-70s saw Judas Priest
        and Mot√∂rhead inject elements of blues and punk into the genre at the
        same time punk rock was evolving. This would all pave the path for the
        early-80s, when the floodgates would open for a new wave of heavy metal
        in the United Kingdom.
