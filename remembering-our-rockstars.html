      <h1>Remembering Our Rockstars</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout the decades, many notable people in the music scene have made
        widespread societal impacts, and many of those people are unfortunately
        no longer with us. These are some of those people who have passed on but
        we still honor their legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as a disclaimer, there are some controversial figures on this list.
        While many people in this article are remembered fondly, there are a few
        that are not quite as well beloved due to their views or actions. The
        reason they may be on this list is because of either their influence or
        their high-profile deaths.
