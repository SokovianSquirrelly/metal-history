      <h1>The Norwegian Black Metal Scene</h1>
      <p>
        Black metal is easily the most controversial subgenre of heavy metal due
        to the culture surrounding it. It's a form of extreme metal that
        commonly includes fast tempos, tremolo picking on guitars, dark lyrics,
        and shrieking vocals. In the early days of black metal, many bands used
        raw, lofi recordings, though much of modern black metal has abandoned
        that trait in their music. It's common to see black metal musicians in
        black and white face paint referred to as "corpse paint" and black
        clothing with spikes. Many black metal bands strive to hide from
        mainstream culture and remain underground.

        Black metal didn't become immediately controversial. The subgenre came
        from death metal and thrash metal bands experimenting with their music
        and pushing the envelope on how intensely dark their music can be. Bands
        that were part of this "first wave" of black metal included Venom,
        Bathory, Hellhammer, and Mercyful Fate. The genre was even named after
        Venom's album, "Black Metal".
      </p>

        The genre didn't explode until the early 1990's in Norway and this
        "second wave" of black metal became known as the "Norwegian Black Metal
        Scene". This drew a lot of controversy throughout Norway and even
        throughout Europe due to the ideology of many black metal musicians,
        which included misanthropy, a practice of Satanism and/or ethnic
        paganism, and a strong hatred for Christianity. The scene attracted
        media attention due to these ideologies and also due to murders and
        church burnings in Norway. Some of the notable bands at this time
        included Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Emporer, and Gorgoroth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, while many early black metal bands are still present, the
        subgenre has widely abandoned controversial practices, though their
        music still evokes dark and often Satanic themes. Unfortunately, a niche
        group of black metal musicians who are considered National Socialst
        Black Metal, or NSBM, carry extreme views on Fascism, anti-semitism, and
        neo-Nazi ideals and portray much of those views in their music and
        imagery. Thankfully, these musicians are largely shunned by prominent
        artists of the black metal community.
