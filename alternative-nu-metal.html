      <h1>Alternative & Nu Metal</h1>
      <p>
        The mid-80s saw a new genre emerge as a mix between heavy metal and
        alternative rock, and sometimes even other genres that aren't generally
        associated with metal. This became known as alternative metal.
        Alternative metal bands often play with downtuned guitars, much like
        much of metal up to this point, but in contrast to genres like thrash
        metal, alternative metal guitar riffs are generally mid-paced. A mix of
        melodic vocals and harsh vocals is also common.
      </p>

        The genre first emerged in the mid-80s with bands like Faith No More,
        Jane's Addiction, and Soundgarden, but the genre wasn't popularized
        until the '90s when bands like Tool and Alice in Chains entered the
        scene. Today, other popular alternative metal bands include Breaking
        Benjamin, Evanescense, and Three Days Grace.

        The alternative metal scene in California spawned a new subgenre called
        nu metal. Nu metal is seen as a fusion between alternative metal and
        other non-metal subgenres, most commonly hip hop, funk, and grunge.
        While many other subgenres of metal show a large display of technical
        competence like guitar solos, nu metal fights against that trend hard.
        The music often has a syncopated rhythm often found in hip hop and funk.
        Vocal technique varies from artist to artist and these techniques
        include singing, screaming, growling, and even rapping. Some bands also
        feature a DJ that handles sampling and turntables.

        Nu metal is one of the more divisive subgenres of heavy metal, being
        criticized for the "dumbing-down" of heavy metal or as being a desperate
        attempt to get into the mainstream. Some even question the legitimacy of
        nu metal even being a true subgenre of heavy metal due to bands being
        more "whiny" in contrast to bands in other metal subgenres that express
        music in a more visceral way. Despite all this, nu metal enjoyed huge
        success during the '90s and early-2000s and it put bands like Linkin
        Park, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Korn, System of a Down, Godsmack,
        Disturbed, and Kid Rock on the map. While nu metal had lost most of its
        popularity by around 2004, this also opened up the doors for others in
        metal. Metalcore was picking up momentum at this time and starting in
        the 2010s, nu metal went through a revival due to metalcore bands like
        Issues and Of Mice & Men mixing the two genres together to create nu
        metalcore. Aside from that, Slipknot, who was one of the heavier and
        more aggresive bands of this era, became a gateway for many elements of
        modern metalcore, deathcore, and death metal.
