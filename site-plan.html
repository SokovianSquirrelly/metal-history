      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Each rectangle with an image and text will be a link to another page, specifically an "era page".

      <h3>Era Page</h3>
      <p>         
        There are 14 era pages, but they're all going to look very similar, so this wireframe will cover
        all of them.  Also, the circle and text at the bottom are meant to play a song specific to that page.
