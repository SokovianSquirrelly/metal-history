      <h1>Miscellaneous Genres</h1>
      <p>
        These subgenres of metal, while they may be popular in certain parts of
        the world, don't have quite the same cultural impact as many other metal
        subgenres. However, they are worth mentioning as they are, in my
        opinion, still worth learning about.
      </p>

      <h3>Doom Metal</h3>

      </div>
      <p>
        While Black Sabbath were the godfathers of heavy metal, they also
        inspired another genre: doom metal. Doom metal is generally heavier,
        slower, and darker than most conventional metal and is meant to bring a
        sense of dread, despair, and impending doom. The genre started to pick
        up traction thanks to bands like Witchfinder General, Candlemass,
        Trouble, and Pentagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though doom metal is considered extreme metal, unlike other extreme
        metal subgenres like death metal or black metal, traditional doom metal
        vocalists use clean vocals, albeit with a depressing tone to convey the
        feeling of dread. However, sub-subgenres of doom metal that are often
        combined with other extreme subgenres may use harsh vocals like death
        growls or screaming.

      <h3>Folk Metal</h3>
      <div class = "misc-pics">
        <img
          src="images/cemican.jpg"
          alt="Retrieved from https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Cemican/3540284609"

      <p>
        Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal and traditional folk music.
        It was developed in Europe throughout the '90s like Skyclad from England
        and Cruachan from Ireland. More and more similar bands popped up in
        other countries, most notably in Finland in the early 2000s. Eventually,
        the genre also picked up a strong presence through the Middle East and
        into Northern Africa with bands such as Jerusalem's Melechesh, Lebanon's
        Kordz, India's Bloodywood, and Egypt's Massive Scar Era.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though most popular in Europe, the Middle East, and Northern Africa, the
        genre has found itself gaining traction throughout the world as bands
        have incorporated their local cultures into their own music. For
        example, Mexican band Cemican uses pre-hispanic instruments fasioned
        after the ones used by the Aztec and Mayan Civilizations. Cemican's
        vocals, rather than being in the band's native Spanish are actually
        often in Mayan or Nahuatl and explore myths and legends of the ancient
        civilizations that lived in Mexico for centuries. When on stage, the
        band is often seen wearing body paint and feather-and-bone armor and
        headresses much like the ancient Aztec warriors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The genre is characterized by the use of traditional instruments in
        conjunction with the standard instrumentation of heavy metal.
        Ocassionally, traditional singing styles are used as well. Lyrical
        themes include fantasy, mythology, and nature. The "metal" part of folk
        metal is quite diverse, as many different subgenres of metal are
        incorporated into this genre. For example, Cemican combines Aztec or
        Mayan music with melodic death metal. Bloodywood combines Indian folk
        music with nu metal. Myrath combines Middle Eastern and Arabic melodies
        with power metal or progressive metal. Many European folk metal bands
        like Moonsorrow use black metal with folk music.

        While there are many notable and influential bands in folk metal,
        including those that were previously mentioned, as of 2022, one of the
        most relevant is the Mongolian folk metal band known as The Hu, which is
        actually an oddball to the world of folk metal. While most folk metal
        bands have a strong presence of heavy metal instrumentation and vocals
        in their music, The Hu primarily sticks with traditional Mongolian
        instruments and throat singing without losing the heaviness and
        intensity that comes with the parent genre. Much of folk metal is
        largely ignored in the United States, but The Hu is an exception to that
        rule, making its presence known and is even starting to have music
        featured in Hollywood and in high-profile video games such as EA's
        "Jedi: Fallen Order".

      <p>
        In 1990, an album was released from Texas-based heavy metal band
        Pantera. This album, named "Cowboys from Hell", is often cited as the
        first groove metal album. This new style of metal evolved from thrash
        metal of the '80s and incorporated raspy or screaming vocals, down-tuned
        guitars, heavy guitar riffs, and syncopated rhythms. Even though groove
        metal evolved from thrash metal, it's often slower than its parent
        genre. Throughout the '90s groove metal spread to bands like White
        Zombie and Machine Head. Today, other notable bands of groove metal
        include Lamb of God, DevilDriver, and Five Finger Death Punch.

        <h5>Rammstein performing in Wacken, Germany</h5>
      </div>
      <p>
        Industrial metal is the fusion of heavy metal and industrial music. This
        music typically includes repeating metal riffs, synthesizers, sampling,
        and distorted vocals. The genre developed in the late '80s with bands
        like Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein, Ministry, Marilyn Manson, and Fear
        Factory. The genre picked up a lot of popularity in North America, but
        that popularity was short-lived, only lasting about a decade. By the
        late '90s to early 2000s, the genre received backlash from critics who
        felt that the industrail sound in heavy metal became too generic.
        Industrial metal bands tried to counter this by adding hip hop and
        electronic into their music, which helped influence nu metal. By this
        point, industrial metal had faded into obscurity.

      <h3>Power Metal</h3>

      </div>
      <p>
        Power metal has its origins in the early '80s in North America with
        Rainbow's lyrical subject matter that revolved around medieval,
        renaissance, folk, and science fiction themes. American power metal was
        generally heavier than the later European power metal that would become
        much more popular. Most of power metal's influence has largely stayed in
        Europe, but that influence is spread across the continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like glam metal, power metal fights against other subgenres of heavy
        metal with lighter and more uplifting music, sometimes with an
        anthem-like feel. However, unlike glam metal, power metal doesn't employ
        elements of pop music, rather using elements of speed metal instead.
        Power metal also has a different lyrical subject matter from glam
        metal's "drugs, sex, & rock n' roll" culture. Instead, power metal's
        lyrical themes are often fantasy-based with strong choruses and a
        dramatic, theatrical, and emotionally powerful sound. Power metal also
        often has a symphonic context to their sound. Notable power metal bands
        include Dragonforce, Sabaton, Helloween, and Blind Guardian.

      </div>
      <p>
        Symphonic metal has its origins across much of Europe, specifically in
        Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands. It refers to heavy metal (or one
        of its subgenres) that has added orchestral and/or operatic elements.
        Some bands do feature orchestral instruments or choirs, while others may
        use keyboard orchestration. Many vocalists for symphonic metal bands
        were trained in classical and opera music so oftentimes they add the
        operatic element to the genre. Notable symphonic metal bands include
        Nightwish, Epica, Within Temptation, and Therion.
