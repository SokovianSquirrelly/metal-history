      <h1>Hair Metal: Where Metal Met Pop</h1>
      <p>
        While many metal bands in the '80s were trying to go heavier and darker,
        there also came a subgenre that went the opposite direction. Rather than
        dark and heavy music of thrash metal, death metal, or black metal, hair
        metal, or more officially known as glam metal, fought against that
        trend. The music employed pop-inspired hooks and guitar riffs, upbeat
        rock anthems, and slower power ballads. Many glam metal musicians
        borrowed clothing style from the glam rock bands of the '70s, which used
        flashy clothing and makeup, spandex, lace, and often bright colors. This
        was in stark contrast to the thrash metal scene, which used denim,
        leather, and a "battle vest".

        The genre has its origins in the United States, more specifically in Los
        Angeles. It became part of the Sunset Strip music scene especially with
        bands such as Mötley Crüe and Quiet Riot. At the same time, hair metal
        bands on the East Coast also spawned such as Bon Jovi and Twisted
        Sister. Other bands include Warrant, Ratt, Hanoi Rocks, and Cinderella.
