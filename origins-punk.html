      <h1>Origins of Punk</h1>
      <p>
        While rock music started out being rebellious in nature, by the mid-70s,
        it had already become mainstream and its rebellious nature had largely
        faded. Some musicians who wanted to preserve the rebellious atmosphere
        of rock n' roll rejected the contemporaries of the genre and shifted
        into an unconventional and harsher tone. This shift was what started
        punk rock. Songs were typically short and fast-paced with hard-edged
        melodies and styles. Lyrics were often shouted and were often about
        politics (or the distaste thereof) and anti-establishment. The genre
        embraces a DIY style and early punk bands produced their own music
        without the oversight or assistance from third-party producers or record
        labels. Early punk rock bands include Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the
        Clash, and Patti Smith. More recent punk rock bands include Green Day,
        Social Distortion, the Offspring, and NOFX.

        Punk rock evolved alongside heavy metal since its inception, giving us
        their own subgenres. One of the earliest subgenres of punk was hardcore
        punk, which started in the late-70s in Southern California. Much like
        its parent genre of punk rock, its lyrics are critical of "the
        establishment", politics, commercialism, and anything that was part of
        the mainstream. These lyrics were purposefully confrontational and
        abrasive. What made this genre "hardcore" was that it was louder,
        heavier, faster, and harder-hitting. This is some of the earliest music
        that had some semblance of "harsh vocals" as the vocals were typically
        shouted, screamed, or chanted. Hardcore punk culture brought upon
        "moshing", which has become a main staple in punk and metal during live
        shows in which participants would push each other or slam into each
        other. Notable hardcore punk bands include Black Flag, Minor Threat, and
        Circle Jerks.

        On the other side of the punk spectrum was pop punk. While hardcore punk
        went harder and faster, pop punk was where one could argue punk decided
        to go back into the mainstream, using elements of pop into punk rock.
        This was largely started by Ramones, though the Undertones and Buzzcocks
        were also early pop punk bands. Throughout the next few decades, pop
        punk also pulled in elements from new wave, sca, boy band, and hip hop.
        Pop punk became most popular in the late-90s and early-2000s with bands
        like Blink-182, Sum 41, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Avril Lavigne,
        and Simple Plan. During the mid-2000s and into the 2010s, many pop punk
        bands were popular with the "emo" and "scene" crowds, such as My
        Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Paramore, and All Time Low.

        While punk is not part of the heavy metal family, it largely has
        influence within the genre. Some prominent heavy metal subgenres heavily
        borrow from punk rock. The British heavy metal bands of the early-80s
        redefined heavy metal by combining the heavy sound of Black Sabbath with
        the speed and intensity of punk rock. Thrash metal borrowed lyrical
        themes from the genre shortly thereafter. Metalcore was based off of
        hardcore punk and perpetuated a similar rebellious nature with the
        "scene" crowd of the 2000s. It's also difficult today to be exclusively
        in the metal community and the punk rock community since the two genres
        are intertwined at this point.
