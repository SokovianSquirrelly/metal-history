      <h1>The Brutality of Death Metal</h1>
      <p>
        Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal, typically with
        heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, aggressive drumming techniques
        such as double kicks and blast beats, palm muting and tremolo picking,
        aggressive, growling vocals, and often a minor, atonal, or chromatic
        chord progression. Lyrics were inspired by many different sources,
        ranging from religion to political conflict to slasher film violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Death metal started in response to thrash metal and early black metal in
        the early to mid-80s. Bands like Slayer and Venom were large influences
        on the death metal scene that started in America. This was a widespread
        movement across America, but a strong death metal scene spawned in
        Florida thanks to bands like Death, Obituary, Deicide, and Morbid Angel.
        Other notable early death metal bands include Possessed, Necrophagia,
        Cannibal Corpse, and Autopsy.

        Even though death metal's influence was rapidly spreading, media
        attention to the new genre quickly moved to the controversial Norwegian
        black metal scene, which left death metal as an underground genre at the
        time, especially in America. However, the early death metal scene went
        on to transform the music scene forever and have a huge impact on pop
        culture in the 21st century.

        Even though the genre was relatively underground in America, its
        influence found solid footing in Europe, especially in Sweden. Sweden
        developed its own death metal scene with bands like Grave, Carnage, God
        Macabre, and Entombed. While much of American death metal was generally
        more abrasive and brutal, Swedish death metal, while still very heavy,
        was more approachable. This new scene became gateway for melodic death
        metal, which combined the brutality that was American death metal with
        melodic or harmonized guitar riffs and sometimes higher-pitched harsh
        vocals. This opened up what was known as the "Gothenburg Metal Scene"
        since Gothenburg was where many of these melodic death, or "melodeath"
        bands originated such as In Flames, At the Gates, and Dark Tranquility.
        The melodeath scene spread across Europe and even into America in the
        late-90s and early-2000s with Swedish bands like Arch Enemy (my personal
        favorite) and Amon Amarth, Finnish bands like Children of Bodom and
        Insomnium, and American bands like The Black Dahlia Murder. This scene
        also went to inspire the rise of melodic metalcore in the 2000s,
        bringing metalcore bands like Killswitch Engage and As I Lay Dying into
        the mainstream.

        Another popular splinter from death metal was technical death metal,
        nicknamed "tech-death". Technical death metal focused more on
        challenging musicianship and complex songwriting. Much of the
        inspiration for this music came from an unlikely source: jazz fusion.
        Complex rhythms, odd time signatures, and heavy use of advanced music
        theory were a staple of this music. Death would be one of the bands to
        start this new subgenre of death metal, along with Pestilence, Atheist,
        Cynic, and Nocturnus.
      </p>
      <p>
        This rise of technical death metal would evolve alongside progressive
        metal, and the line between death metal and progressive metal often
        became blurred, which led to bands like Meshuggah and Opeth. Today, one
        of the biggest technical death metal bands is Archspire.

        On the opposite side from melodic death metal and technical death metal
        is brutal death metal. Brutal death metal puts more emphasis on the
        abrasiveness and speed of its music, often at the cost of melody and
        technical elements. Some of the most notable brutal death metal bands
        include Suffocation, Cattle Decapitation, Cryptopsy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brutal death metal also led to a microgenre called slam death metal, or
        often just simply known as "slam". Slam is a more niche genre, but it is
        often the butt of jokes in the metal community, so I figured I'd share.
        Slam takes brutal death metal and combines it with elements of hardcore
        punk and hip hop. Unlike most of death metal, guitar solos and
        blastbeats are all but non-existent. Instead, it employs mid-tempo
        rhythms, breakdowns, and palm-muted riffing inspired from Suffocation's
        song, "Liege of Inveracity". Notable slam bands include Devourment and
        Cephalotripsy.
