      <h1>The Brutality of Death Metal</h1>
      <p>
        Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal, typically with
        heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, aggressive drumming techniques
        such as double kicks and blast beats, palm muting and tremolo picking,
        aggressive, growling vocals, and often a minor, atonal, or chromatic
        chord progression.

        Death metal started in response to thrash metal and early black metal in
        the early to mid-80s. Bands like Slayer and Venom were large influences
        on the death metal scene that started in America with bands like
        Possessed, Morbid Angel, Obituary, Autopsy, Cannibal Corpse, and Death.
        The genre peaked in the early-90s. However due to the media attention
        given to the controversial Norwegian black metal scene, death metal
        never really broke into the mainstream especially in America.

        The subgenre did however spread to Sweden quickly where it developed its
        own death metal scene with bands like Grave, Carnage, God Macabre, and
        Entombed. These bands became gateway for melodic death metal, which
        combined the brutality that was American death metal with melodic or
        harmonized guitar riffs and sometimes higher-pitched harsh vocals. This
        opened up what was known as the "Gothenburg Metal Scene" since many of
        these melodic death, or "melodeath" bands originated such as In Flames,
        At the Gates, and Dark Tranquility. The melodeath scene spread across
        Europe and even into America in the late-90s and early-2000s with
        Swedish bands like Arch Enemy (my personal favorite) and Amon Amarth,
        Finnish bands like Children of Bodom, and American bands like The Black
        Dahlia Murder. This scene also went to inspire the rise of melodic
        metalcore in the 2000s, bringing metalcore bands like Killswitch Engage
        and As I Lay Dying into the mainstream.
