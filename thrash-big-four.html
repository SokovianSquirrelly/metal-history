      <h1>Thrash & The Big Four</h1>
      <p>
        Thrash metal is defined by its more extreme take on heavy metal, being
        often faster and more aggresive than most conventional heavy metal at
        the time. Common elements of the genre include fast, percussive beats, a
        shredding lead guitar, and low-register guitar riffs. Lyrical themes
        were often critical about politics, environmental ruin, and occasionally
        Christianity. In a lot of ways, thrash metal lyrical themes were similar
        to those of hardcore punk. In fact, it's not wrong to say that thrash is
        a light fusion between hardcore punk and British heavy metal at the
        time. The philosophy of the genre was born out of a rejection of
        Reagan-era conservative views as well as the more pop-inspired metal
        subgenre known as glam metal.

        This era spawned the "Big Four", which is a term given to Metallica,
        Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax. These bands were the most influential and
        commercially successful in the genre. In fact, as of 2022, Metallica is
        the most commercially successful band across all of heavy metal of all
        time. These bands helped to define and build the genre of thrash metal.

        The thrash metal scene spawned most prominently in three distinct
        regions. Bands like Metallica, Megadeth, and Testament came from the San
        Francisco Bay Area and had a more progressive and technical sound to
        their music. On the East Coast, especially in New York, bands like
        Anthrax, Nuclear Assault, and Overkill had a more punk-like sound which
        inspired Crossover Thrash. And in Europe, bands like Kreator,
        Destruction, and Sodom hailed from Germany and borrowed elements from
        both West Coast and East Coast thrash while often employing death metal
        vocals to create Teutonic thrash metal. Oh, and I would be remiss if I
        didn't mention Sepultura, who hailed from Brazil but who's sound closely
        resembles the German thrash scene.

        Thrash metal also inspired what has become known as the "battle vest". A
        battle vest is another name for a sleeveless denim vest with sewn-on
        patches of various bands on it. This has become a cultural piece of the
        larger metal scene.
      </p>

        By the mid-90s, the genre had declined in popularity in favor of
        alternative metal, grunge, and nu metal. However, it was instrumental in
        developing other heavier subgenres like death metal, black metal, and
        groove metal.

        Even though by 1990, thrash metal had largely faded from mainstream
        popularity, it did directly influence groove metal. The first groove
        metal album would come from the Texas-based heavy metal band known as
        Pantera, and the album was known as "Cowboy's from Hell", which gave a
        new style of metal evolved from thrash metal while incorporating raspy
        vocals, down-tuned guitars, heavy riffs, and syncopated rhythms. Unlike
        its fast-paced parent, groove metal tends to have a slower tempo than
        thrash. Aside from Pantera, the genre was also popularized by White
        Zombie and Machine Head. Today, some of the more notable groove metal
        bands include Lamb of God, DevilDriver, and five Finger Death Punch.
