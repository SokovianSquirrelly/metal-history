      <h1>Thrash & The Big Four</h1>
      <p>
        Thrash metal is defined by its more extreme take on heavy metal, being
        often faster and more aggresive than most conventional heavy metal at
        the time. Common elements of the genre include fast, percussive beats, a
        shredding lead guitar, and low-register guitar riffs. Lyrical themes
        were often critical about politics, environmental ruin, and occasionally
        Christianity. In a lot of ways, thrash metal lyrical themes were similar
        to those of hardcore punk. In fact, it's not wrong to say that thrash is
        a light fusion between hardcore punk and British heavy metal at the
        time.

        This era also spawned the "Big Four", which is a term often given to
        Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax. These bands were the most
        influential and commercially successful in the genre. In fact, as of
        2022, Metallica is the most commercially successful band across all of
        heavy metal of all time. These bands helped to define and build the
        genre of thrash metal.

        While the genre mostly popularized in the United States, especially in
        the San Francisco Bay Area, there also became a large scene of thrash
        metal in Germany with bands like Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and
        Tankard. Other notable thrash metal bands include Sepultura, Testament,
        Overkill, and Exodus.
      </p>

        By the mid-90s, the genre had declined in popularity in favor of
        alternative metal, grunge, and nu metal. However, it did help to start a
        new genre during that time known as groove metal which was headed by
        Pantera.
