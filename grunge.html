      <h1>Seattle's Grunge Scene</h1>
      <p>
        Also known as the "Seattle sound", grunge music and culture emerged
        during the mid-1980s in Washington state, specifically in and around
        Seattle. Grunge has a lot of influences from alternative rock, punk
        rock, early heavy metal, hardcore punk, and sludge metal. However, the
        fast speed of punk is practically non-existent. Instrumentals are
        heavily distorted and has what many would consider a "grungy" sound to
        it. Lyrical themes are typically angsty and addresses a lot of heavier
        introspective themes like betrayal, self-doubt, abuse, neglect, and
        trauma. Many of these lyrical themes became easy for teenagers to relate
        to and the genre became incredibly popular in the '90s.

        Many notable grunge bands popped up in Seattle, such as Nirvana, Pearl
        Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. Outside of Seattle, bands like
        Stone Temple pilots and The Smashing Pumpkins were also frontrunners in
        the genre. Some of these bands would heavily influence alternative
        metal, and eventually other subgenres like post-grunge. However, even
        though grunge was incredibly popular during the early '90s, the
        popularity of the genre was very short-lived. By the end of the decade,
        many grunge bands had either broken up or became more obscure. One of
        the largest hits to the culture and genre was the suicide of Nirvana
        frontman, Kurt Cobain, who had also struggled with substance abuse
        leading up to his death.

        Even though the genre was so short-lived, it had an important impact on
        society outside of music. First off, it helped the city of Seattle.
        Before the 1990s, Seattle was a very different place than it is now. It
        was essentially a blue-collar logging town with no real music scene.
        Bands would skip Seattle when they were on tour because to them, it was
        just a bigger town that was just too far out of the way to justify
        scheduling a concert. In fact, the clothing style of grunge was
        reflective of the kind of city that Seattle was at the time, with
        flannel and doc martins. Fast forward to today, where Seattle has two
        big things going for it: being a tourist location and being a technology
        hub. Because grunge music made Seattle look like a hot and happening
        place, some of the biggest tech companies in the world emerged, such as
        Boeing, Microsoft, and Amazon. This change may not have happened
        overnight, but the city of Seattle has changed drastically since the
        1990s thanks to grunge.

        However, probably the most important change that grunge brought to
        society was the importance of introspection and self-exploration. Grunge
        resonated deeply with teenagers at the time, especially in Seattle. Not
        only were the lyrics introspective, but they were seen as down-to-earth.
        The musicians also went against the trend of glam metal at the time,
        where rather than dressing up in colorful spandex, the musicians looked
        like they just walked on stage with whatever they were wearing for the
        day. The musicians were more approachable, which seems weird to bring
        up, but before 1992, the concept of a "down-to-earth celebrity" was
        incredibly foreign. Teenagers saw themselves in these bands, especially
        with the likes of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain or Soundgarden's Chris Cornell.
        This was because those musicians were those teenagers that felt stranded
        in their "crappy home town" and struggled to find their place in life.
        Over the years, this introspective music carried over into other popular
        genres like metalcore, emo, and punk. As time went on, more and more
        important issues like mental health came to light, and it can be argued
        that society and pop culture has become more compassionate and accepting
        as a result.

        After grunge had largely faded, a derivative of grunge called
        post-grunge would emerge. The sound was less abrasive than its parent
        genre, though still had a lot of thick, distorted guitars and
        introspective lyrics. Post-grunge is also largely intertwined with
        alternative metal, arguably more so than grunge ever was. Because of it
        being less abraisive, post-grunge is much more radio-friendly and is
        often nicknamed "butt rock". Notable post-grunge bands include Foo
        Fighters, Bush, Creed, Shinedown, Seether, and Nickelback.
