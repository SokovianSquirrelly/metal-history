      <h1>Seattle's Grunge Scene</h1>
      <p>
        Also known as the "Seattle sound", grunge music and culture emerged
        during the mid-1980s in Washington state, specifically in and around
        Seattle. Grunge has a lot of influences from alternative rock, punk
        rock, early heavy metal, hardcore punk, and sludge metal. However, the
        fast speed of punk is practically non-existent. Instrumentals are
        heavily distorted and has what many would consider a "grungy" sound to
        it. Lyrical themes are typically angsty and addresses a lot of heavier
        introspective themes like betrayal, self-doubt, abuse, neglect, and
        trauma. Many of these lyrical themes became easy for teenagers to relate
        to and the genre became incredibly popular in the '90s.

        Many notable grunge bands popped up in Seattle, such as Nirvana, Pearl
        Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. Outside of Seattle, bands like
        Stone Temple pilots and The Smashing Pumpkins were frontrunners in the
        genre. Some of these bands would heavily influence alternative metal,
        and eventually other subgenres like post-grunge. However, even though
        grunge was incredibly popular during the '90s, by the end of the
        century, many grunge bands had either broken up or became more obscure.
        One of the largest hits to the culture and genre was the suicide of
        Nirvana frontman, Kurt Cobain, who had also struggled with substance
        abuse leading up to his death. While the genre was short-lived, it
        brought a lot of important issues into pop culture and helped promote
        intropsection and self-exploration.

        After grunge had largely faded, a derivative of grunge called
        post-grunge would emerge. The sound was less abrasive than its parent
        genre, though still had a lot of thick, distorted guitars and
        introspective lyrics. Post-grunge is also largely intertwined with
        alternative metal, arguably more so than grunge ever was. Notable
        post-grunge bands include Foo Fighters, Bush, Creed, Shinedown, Seether,
        and Nickelback.
