      <h1>What Your Favorite Band Says About You</h1>
      <p>
        There is a joke associated with each band and artist here. They don't
        even have to be rock or metal! Just know this is all in good fun as we
        roast the fanbases of so many musicians. Even some of my favorite bands
        are up here so don't take this too personally.

            To you, any metal band that has more than 100 monthly listeners on
            Spotify aren't "real metal".
