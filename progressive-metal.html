      <h1>Progressive Metal &...Djent?</h1>
      <p>
        Back in the late-60s to early-70s, progressive rock was formed as a
        broad genre of rock music being experimented with and combined with
        other music genres such as classical, jazz, or folk. The purpose was
        less about making music to dance to and more about making music that was
        technically impressive. Progressive metal is a fusion of progressive
        rock and heavy metal. It's well known for being a showcase of technical
        and experimental skills, using complex rhythms, unorthodox melodies,
        intense syncopation, and frequent stylistic changes within one song.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progressive metal met its debut in the mid-80s with bands like
        Queensr√øche and Dream Theater. Later on, the genre became more
        diversified by bands such as Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, and
        Meshuggah combining jazz fusion with death metal, Devin Townsend using
        ambient sounds with heavy metal, and King Goat, Sierra, and Below the
        Sun using doom metal with general progressive metal.

        Progressive metal also spawned a subgenre known as djent inspired by the
        hard-hitting guitar sound of Meshuggah, who are often considered the
        godfathers of djent. Djent is often characterized by guitar riffs being
        hard-hitting, palm-muted, and syncopated, which is where the subgenre
        gets its name, which is an onomatopoeia of those riffs. Guitars also
        often had an extended range by employing guitars with up to nine
        strings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Djent is fairly divisive genre with some musicians not recognizing it as
        a genre at all, rather that it was just a short-lived stylistic fad of
        progressive metal. Even members of Meshuggah, who again, are considered
        godfathers of the genre, have distanced themselves away from the term
        "djent" since they didn't coin the term and they felt it was a whole
        genre created solely based on lead guitarist Fredrik Thordendal's
        playing style. Djent has also been the subject of memes due to musicians
        and critics finding it corny or silly, despite djent bands like
        Tesseract, Animals as Leaders and Periphery receiving praise from
        critics.
