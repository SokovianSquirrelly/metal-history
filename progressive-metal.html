      <h1>Progressive Metal</h1>
      <p>
        Back in the late-60s to early-70s, progressive rock was formed as a
        broad genre of rock music being experimented with and combined with
        other music genres such as classical, jazz, or folk. The purpose was
        less about making music to dance to and more about making music that was
        technically impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progressive metal is a fusion of progressive rock and heavy metal. It's
        well known for being a showcase of technical and experimental skills,
        using complex rhythms, unorthodox melodies, intense syncopation, and
        frequent stylistic changes within one song.
      </p>

        Progressive metal met its debut with bands like Queensr√øche and Dream
        Theater. Later on, the genre became more diversified by bands such as
        Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, and Meshuggah combining jazz fusion
        with death metal, Devin Townsend using ambient sounds with heavy metal,
        and King Goat, Sierra, and Below the Sun using doom metal with general
        progressive metal.

      <p>
        Progressive metal also spawned a subgenre known as djent inspired by the
        hard-hitting guitar sound of Meshuggah. Djent is often characterized by
        guitar riffs being hard-hitting, palm-muted, and syncopated. Guitars
        also often had an extended range by employing guitars with up to nine
        strings. Djent is a fairly divisive genre with some musicians not
        recognizing it as a genre at all, rather that it was just a short-lived
        stylistic fad of progressive metal. Djent has also been the subject of
        memes due to musicians finding it corny or silly. Bands that played
        djent music include Tesseract, Animals as Leaders, and Periphery.
