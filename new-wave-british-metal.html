      <h1>New Wave of British Heavy Metal</h1>
      <p>
        Starting in the mid-70s, the United Kingdom had seen a boom of heavy
        metal bands inspired by the likes of Black Sabbath and Judas Priest.
        However, many of these bands didn't achieve the mainstream until the
        '80s where they recieved more media attention. Many of these bands were
        mixing in elements of Black Sabbath's heavy sound with the often fast
        and intense music of punk rock, and it sent a message that metal was
        here to stay and wasn't just a music fad from some guys in England. This
        also spawned branching subgenres in America and Europe like glam metal
        and thrash metal. Notable bands from this era included Iron Maiden and
        Def Leppard.

        This was also a breakthrough for Ozzy Osbourne who quickly became a
        household name. Osbourne was already famous for being the frontman of
        the legendary Black Sabbath, but upon being dismissed from the band in
        the late-70s became a solo artist. His debut solo album "Blizzard of
        Ozz", held heavy metal anthems such as "Crazy Train" and "Mr. Crowley"
        and as of 2019 became 5x platinum (meaning it sold over 5 million
        copies). Today, Ozzy Osbourne holds the nickname "Prince of Darkness"
        due to his influence on heavy metal.
